				<b>Cindy Karina Cano</b><br/><i>Chief Web Officer, Personal Experiences Section Head, Contributor</i><br /><br />
				When she is not stress napping as a computer science and mathematics student at Emory University, Cindy spends her free time binge-watching shows, laughing at mansplainers, and trying to pet every animal she sees.

She also enjoys nature photography and poetry, which she posts on her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cin.die">Instagram</a>.</p>
